# IsoPois Backend

The IsoPois backend is built with FastAPI and provides a RESTful API for managing points of interest (POIs) and their associated geospatial data. It interacts with the database to perform CRUD operations and serves the frontend application.

## Development

### Environment

```sh
# FastAPI prefix
